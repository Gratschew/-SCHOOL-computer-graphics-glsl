In this coding assignment, I implemented a basic real-time ray tracer using ray marching and signed distance functions (SDFs). This approach is also known as sphere tracing. 

I implemented the following functionalities for the assignment:

- Perspective projection
- Phong shading
- Camera movement and rotation
- Sharp shadows
- Tone mapping
- Soft shadows
- Sharp reflections
- SDF Ambient Occlusions
- Texturing
- Simple own SDF
- Advanced own SDF
- Animated SDF
